## Installation

### Executable (Might be Slow)

The JEE Counsellor tool is available as an executable for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Follow the instructions below to run the tool on your respective operating system.

> **Note:** The provided installation method is only compatible with the x86_64 architecture. It will not work on other architectures.

#### Windows

- Download the `jcounsellor.exe` executable file from the [latest release](https://github.com/ksauraj/jee_counsellor/releases).

- Before running the tool, Windows may display a security warning message that prevents the execution of the tool. This is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of your system. However, since jcounsellor is an open-source tool, you can bypass this security check and run the tool.

  - Here are two methods to bypass the security check:

    - Method 1: Use the "Run Anyway" option

      - When the security warning message appears, click on the "More info" link.
      - A new option "Run Anyway" should appear. Click on it to run the tool.

    - Method 2: Unblock the file

      - Right-click on the jcounsellor.exe file.
      - Select "Properties" from the context menu.
      - In the Properties window, locate and click on the "Unblock" button, if available.
      - Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save the changes.

    - By choosing the "Run Anyway" option or unblocking the file, you are indicating that you trust the source and intend to run the tool on your system.

    - Double-click the jcounsellor.exe file to run the tool. You should now be able to launch and use jcounsellor without any issues.
